# Scuber 

Ridesharing for students: safer, faster, cheaper.

## Why not use [insert Uber clone here]?

As it is right now, school transport is flawed. Carpools are inefficient, public transport even more so, and traditional ridesharing services are expensive and lack the social aspect of a tight-knit school community.

Scuber is the solution, providing localized ridesharing for school communities, improving ridesharing efficiency while helping with the environment, all while being more personal than services like Uber.

Scuber is (usually) free for its users, making it an even more enticing choice for students looking for a ride.
